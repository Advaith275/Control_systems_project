# Control_systems_project
Created a project to solve for few problems based on a given system and the transfer function associated with it:

1. The objective of this experiment is to analysis and design of control 
systems specific to a physical system. Each student will be given a specific 
physical system, and experiments are to be conducted on that particular 
physical system 
a. The objective of this exercise is to obtain the open loop 
characteristics of the given transfer function of the physical system 
or plant. (i) Where are the poles and zeros located? Obtain the polezero map. (ii) Apply different test signals, and observe the timedomain response. Discuss the results obtained from the viewpoint 
of pole-zero map. 
2. The objective of this exercise is to determine the range of a gain that 
assures closed loop stability. Assume that the given system is part of a 
unity negative feedback system, and there is a gain in cascade with the 
given system in the forward path. Conduct experiments similar to 
(project2-1) and determine the range of k for which the closed loop 
system is stable. 
3. The objective of the exercise to analyse the closed loop system behaviour 
with proportional controller of the system whose transfer function you 
were given earlier. 
a. Place a gain k in the forward path, and close the loop with negative 
unity feedback. Take different values for k. For each value of in this 
set, obtain the step response. What is the rise time, the settling 
time? Are there any oscillations? If so, what is the frequency of 
oscillation? Compare the response of the closed loop system to the 
open loop system. Compare the closed loop responses. Discuss the 
results. Can we increase k indefinitely? 
b. Obtain the root locus. Mark the earlier choices of k on the root 
locus. Discuss the results obtained from the root locus with 
reference to those obtained with k in the forward path in part 3(a). 
4. The objective of this exercise is to obtain the closed loop behaviour with 
proportional plus derivative controller of the system you were given earlier. 
Place a function K (s + z) in the forward path, and close the loop with negative 
unity feedback. Take different values for K and z. For each sets of (K,z) obtain 
the step response, and the rlocus. Compare the step response for each case, 
and compare with the case of putting only a gain K in the forward path. What 
is therefore the effect of adding a zero in the forward path? Are there any 
additional insight to be gained from the rlocus: Obtain the root locus for each 
case. Compare the three loci, and discuss the results. 
5. (a)The objective of this exercise is to obtain the closed loop behaviour with 
proportional plus integral controller of the system you were given earlier. (i) 
Place a function 𝐾((𝑠 + 𝑧)/𝑠) in the forward path, and close the loop with 
negative unity feedback. Take different values for 𝐾 and 𝑧, For each sets of 
(𝐾, 𝑧)obtain the step response, and the root locus. Compare the step 
response for each case, and compare with the case of putting only a gain 𝐾in 
the forward path and 𝐾(𝑠 + 𝑧). What is therefore the effect of adding a pole 
in the forward path? Are there any additional insights to be gained from the 
root locus. Compare the three loci, and discuss the results. Hence (ii) infer the 
results if the following function 𝐾ଵ +
௄మ
௦
+ 𝐾ଷ𝑠 is placed in the forward path. 
Substantiate your answer for suitable choices of 𝐾ଵ,𝐾ଶ and 𝐾ଷ. 
(b) The objective of this exercise is to analyse the system in frequencydomain. Obtain the Bode and Nyquist plot for the system you were given 
earlier. What are the gain and phase margins? What can you conclude 
about the stability of your system? 
6. The objective of this exercise is to obtain the closed loop behaviour with Lead 
or Lag compensator of the system you were given earlier. (i) Place a function 
௄(ఛ௦ା )
ఈ(ఈఛ௦ )
 in the forward path, and close the loop with negative unity feedback 
for Lag compensator and ௄(ఈఛ௦ାଵ)
ఈ(ఛ௦ା )
 for Lead compensator. For fixed K, take 
different values for 𝛼 and 𝜏, For each sets of (𝛼, 𝜏)obtain the Bode and Nyquist 
plots of the modified transfer function. Determine the phase and gain margins 
and also determine the step response of the closed loop transfer function. In 
addition, obtain the root locus plot. Discuss the results, and draw conclusions. 
Compare the results with P, PD in the forward path.
